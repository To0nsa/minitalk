 * to 1, allowing the client to proceed with sending the next bit.
 *
 * It is declared as `volatile sig_atomic_t` to ensure:
 * - `volatile`: The compiler doesn't optimize out reads/writes due to changes
 *    happening asynchronously from a signal handler.
 * - `sig_atomic_t`: Ensures the variable is accessed atomically and safely
